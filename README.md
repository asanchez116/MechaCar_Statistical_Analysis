## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

    * Variables that contribute to the non-random varience of mpg values in the dataset include vehicle_length and ground_clearence.

2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?


    *  The slope of the linear model would not be considered zero since the significnace level of the regression analsyis is less than 0.05 
(p=0.0000000000535). 

3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

    *  This linear model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively wiht an R squared value of 0.7149 indicating that the model explains 71% of the varience.
